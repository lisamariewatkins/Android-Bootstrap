# Android-Bootstrap
Why rebuild the wheel? I built this bootstrap so I can quickly try new libraries without starting from absolute 0.

I've added it to a public GitHub repository so that you can, too!

This bootstrap is best suited for Kotlin developers wishing to quickly set up an MVVM app equipped with Dagger.
